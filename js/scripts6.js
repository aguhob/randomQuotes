"Of all spiritual teachings, the Tao is deepest. To understand it: go slow, keep simple. Or you may miss it. Everything has two extremes. You cannot survive in the extremest. The Tao is in the middle. Where there's no energy in either direction. How long can a pendulum stay at rest? Forever. That is Tao. The center. But it doesn't stay static and fixed. -My summary of the Untethered Soul, ch 18.",

"Disrupt the autopilot. Life is meaningless, so it is up to us to assign it meaning. :)  -M",

"Everyone wants a happy life without difficulties or suffering. We create many of the problems we face. No one intentionally creates problems, but we tend to be slaves to powerful emotions like anger, hatred and attachment that are based on misconceived projections about people and things. We need to find ways of reducing these emotions by eliminating the ignorance that underlies them and applying opposing forces.  -D. Lama",

"The tension should be in your wanting to push yourself more, and in your deliberately not letting yourself, with self-awareness of what is going on. You make sure that the beginning is only encouraging, so easy that you might even smile a little being like, what is this?

"Inner truth is the accumulated power of spiritual experience. It is knowledge of the cosmic laws we have acquired through self-development.
